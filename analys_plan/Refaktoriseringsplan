For better SoC, SRP, we mainly need to decompose CarController
SoC : split the system into parts where each part handles one concern
SRP : a class should have one main responsibility, so it has one primary reason to change

CarController - it currently has multiple responsibilities
1. write a new class CollisionLogic to check for wall and workshop collisions,
give CollisionLogic a method collided so we can call from CarController,
move if-statement for collisions from TimeListener in CarController to CollisionLogic

- relation to CarView to get panelWidth, panelHeight

2. write a new class WorkshopService to handles the rule for workshop collisions,
give WorkshopService a method meetVolvo240 so we can call from CarController,
 - receive a Car when collision with workshop happened
 - check if it's a Volvo240, load it into Workshop<Volvo240>
 - otherwise, non-Volvo240 can drive pass it? bounce?
